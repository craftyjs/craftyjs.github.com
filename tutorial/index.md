Welcome to the Crafty tutorial section. This is very much a work in progress. You can find already written chapters to the left. Please help out by [forking](https://github.com/craftyjs/craftyjs.github.com)


The proposed way to structure the tutorials is to explain only one topic in each chapter. If other (perhaps more advanced) parts of Crafty are required to aid in examples and text, a reference should be given to a chapter explaining the topic in detail, and a simple explanation can be given in place.

The bananabomber chapter was written by sorenbs a while ago. I have updated it and ported it to markdown to provide a starting point and quick syntax reference.

Please have in mind that a lot has happened in the last year and as such code presented in old articles are of little use. If you need help and are not using the latest version pf Crafty, the first thing we will help you with is to update :-)
