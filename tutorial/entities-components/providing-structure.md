Crafty is a JavaScript library to help you build HTML5 games.  Learning the library will be easier for you if take a moment to understand the Way of Crafty, read through the vocabulary, and map these concepts to a simple game.

# The Crafty Way

Here is one attempt at explaining the overall choices in making Crafty.  Like the [Zen of Python] (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), a short list of principles brings clarity of thought, creates focus in discussions, and is generally regarded as a great invention on par with sliced bread.

**The Crafty Way**

The purpose is to help make great games,
tools are elegant when they help the purpose.
Every game will be different,
but there is no need to reinvent everything for each game.
Inheritence is usually the wrong way to reuse code,
traits are usually the right way.
Keystroke count counts,
but don't be mystical.
It's better to have one complex call than ten short ones,
but maybe we can just chain the calls together.
Games are too small for namespaces,
and too much organzing hurts more than it helps,
The code should be in front of you.
The library should fit in your head.


# The Magic Words of Crafty

Every library has a vocabulary of concepts and terms.  Each is explained in more detail somewhere else in the tutorial.
